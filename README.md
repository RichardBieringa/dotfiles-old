# Richard's Dotfiles

My configuration files for the tools that I use such as nvim.

Depends on [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).


### Features:
- üñ• zsh + oh my zsh
- üöÄ Starship as a fancy $PS1 
- üç∫ Basic Brew packages so I don't have to install it all again
- ‚ú® GNU > Mac OS (BSD) default utils
- üçé Sane Mac OS defaults


## Installation 

Clone the repository with submodules

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/RichardBieringa/dotfiles.git
```

Or initialize submodules afterwards

```sh
git submodule init 
git submodule update
```

Symlink the configuration files

```sh
make install
```

### MacOS specific steps

There are some additional settings to change for my MacOS setup:
- Set up sane MacOS defaults
- Install Oh My Zsh
- Install brew package manager, and a list of packages


**Note:** Requires elevated privileges for setting MacOS defaults

```sh
sudo make macos


# only installs brew and brew packages
make brew
```

## Uninstall

```sh
make clean
```
